        <p>Welcome to my home page. Here is where I would like to take a little time to talk about myself and my work ethic.
        After graduating from Borah High School in Boise, Idaho in 2013 I went straight into my first job working in the food industry 
        at a local horse track. From there I have been working at different resteraunts, most notibly a major pizza chain where I started as a delivery driver in 
        the fall of 2014, until I became an assistant manager three years later and contiued to be one for another three. I enjoyed being an assitant full time
    but always felt like nothing was ever going to become of that job.</p>

        <p>In 2020 I decided that I was going to futher my career opportunities by returning to college. While still continuing to work as an assistant manager full time
            I began the Software Development program at the College of Western Idaho as a full time student. There I discovered a love for programming. I found 
        I enjoyed putting in the hard work and hours it took to complete programs. While some days proved to be stressful there was no better feeling in seeing
    a completed program written fully by myself come to life. Each day I expanded my knowledge of programming as well as solidified my time managment skills
     in order to complete the degree in two years while still continuing my full time work position. I still continue to grow in my knowledge 
    in computer languages and am eager to learn more tools in this ever evolving field.  </p>

        <p>If you would like to see more information about work experience or completed college courses those are listed in the <a class="intouch" href="experience.html">Experience</a> tab. Feel free to 
            contact me at <a href="tel:+01-208-809-8315">208-809-8315</a> or email me in the <a class="intouch" href="Contact.html">Contact</a> tab.
        </p>
    
        <p>Thank you for your time!</p>
